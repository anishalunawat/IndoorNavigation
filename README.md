# IndoorNavigatio
    Built an Android Application to navigate inside a building. I used wifi-fingerprinting for navigating inside IIITB campus. The app can be easily modified to work with BLE device.
    Key features: Audio and visual directions, tracking current location, inter-floor navigation, Wi-Fi-fingerprinting, GPS integration, and application interaction with APIs.
    These are some of the snapshots of the App.
